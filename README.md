**PubdeskMD**

Do you use Jekyll, Hugo, Svelte to generate static websites using Markdown MD files?

Have you felt the need to edit the markdown files in WYSWYG editor, save as draft, preview it and when ready push the files to Github, all from a web interface? 

Then **PubdeskMD** is the software for you. We use Oauth to connect to Github, use WYSWYG editor to edit and push MD files. The core logic is published as an open source MIT license.
